Basic Markdown Syntax for README

	1.	Main Header: Use # for the main header (H1).

Here is some `inline code`.


	•	For multi-line code blocks, use triple backticks   or indent with four spaces.



def hello_world():
print(“Hello, World!”)




	6.	Links:
	•	Use [link text](URL) to create hyperlinks.
