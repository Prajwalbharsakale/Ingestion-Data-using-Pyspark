Here’s an outline of how you can implement SCD Type 2 in Snowflake, starting with creating source and target tables, inserting sample data, and then applying logic to handle changes.

1. Creating Source and Target Tables

Source Table DDL (Customer Table)

CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE customer_source (
    customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name STRING,
    last_name STRING,
    email STRING,
    phone_number STRING,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP
);

Target Table DDL (Customer SCD Type 2 Table)

CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE customer_scd2 (
    customer_id INT,
    first_name STRING,
    last_name STRING,
    email STRING,
    phone_number STRING,
    start_date TIMESTAMP,
    end_date TIMESTAMP,
    current_flag BOOLEAN,
    PRIMARY KEY(customer_id, start_date)
);

2. Insert Sample Data into Source Table

INSERT INTO customer_source (customer_id, first_name, last_name, email, phone_number, updated_at) VALUES
(1, 'John', 'Doe', 'john.doe@example.com', '123-456-7890', '2023-01-01 12:00:00'),
(2, 'Jane', 'Smith', 'jane.smith@example.com', '987-654-3210', '2023-01-01 12:00:00');

3. Inserting Initial Data into Target Table (SCD Type 2)

INSERT INTO customer_scd2 (customer_id, first_name, last_name, email, phone_number, start_date, end_date, current_flag) 
SELECT customer_id, first_name, last_name, email, phone_number, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, NULL, TRUE 
FROM customer_source;

4. Logic to Track Changes and Implement SCD Type 2

To implement SCD Type 2, you will need logic to:

	•	Identify changes in the source.
	•	Update the existing records in the target (end the old record by setting the end_date and current_flag).
	•	Insert a new version of the record for the changes.

Step 1: Identify Changed Records

WITH changes AS (
    SELECT s.customer_id, s.first_name, s.last_name, s.email, s.phone_number
    FROM customer_source s
    LEFT JOIN customer_scd2 t
    ON s.customer_id = t.customer_id AND t.current_flag = TRUE
    WHERE (s.first_name <> t.first_name OR s.last_name <> t.last_name OR 
           s.email <> t.email OR s.phone_number <> t.phone_number)
)

Step 2: Expire the Old Record in Target Table

UPDATE customer_scd2
SET end_date = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, current_flag = FALSE
FROM changes
WHERE customer_scd2.customer_id = changes.customer_id
AND customer_scd2.current_flag = TRUE;

Step 3: Insert the New Record into Target Table

INSERT INTO customer_scd2 (customer_id, first_name, last_name, email, phone_number, start_date, end_date, current_flag)
SELECT customer_id, first_name, last_name, email, phone_number, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, NULL, TRUE
FROM changes;

5. Testing with New Changes

Now you can insert new data into the source table to simulate changes:

INSERT INTO customer_source (customer_id, first_name, last_name, email, phone_number, updated_at) VALUES
(1, 'John', 'Doe', 'john.d.new@example.com', '123-456-7890', '2023-02-01 12:00:00'); -- email changed

Then, run the change tracking logic again to update the target table accordingly.

6. Final Check for Target Table Data

You can query the target table to see how the changes are reflected:

SELECT * FROM customer_scd2 ORDER BY customer_id, start_date;

This approach will allow you to track historical changes using SCD Type 2 logic in Snowflake.
