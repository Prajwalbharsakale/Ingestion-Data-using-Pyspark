# Expire old records in the target table by setting end_date and current_flag = False
```python
df_scd2.loc[df_scd2["customer_id"].isin(df_changes["customer_id"]), "end_date"] = current_timestamp()
df_scd2.loc[df_scd2["customer_id"].isin(df_changes["customer_id"]), "current_flag"] = False
```
## Explain me this in details 



### Sure! Let’s break down the code snippet you provided, which is part of implementing a Slowly Changing Dimension (SCD) Type 2 pattern in data warehousing, particularly focused on updating records in a target DataFrame (df_scd2). Here’s what each part of the code is doing:

## Context

### In SCD Type 2, historical records are preserved in a dimension table, allowing you to track changes over time. Each record in the dimension table has an end_date to indicate when it was no longer current, and a current_flag to signify whether a record is the most recent version of that data.

## Code Breakdown

## Code Snippet
```python
df_scd2.loc[df_scd2["customer_id"].isin(df_changes["customer_id"]), "end_date"] = current_timestamp()
df_scd2.loc[df_scd2["customer_id"].isin(df_changes["customer_id"]), "current_flag"] = False
```

### Explanation

	1.	df_scd2: This is the target DataFrame that represents the Slowly Changing Dimension (SCD) table. It contains records of customers with attributes like customer_id, end_date, and current_flag.
	2.	df_changes: This DataFrame contains the changes or updates for customers that have occurred since the last load. It includes at least a customer_id column to identify which customers have updates.
	3.	current_timestamp(): This function (or variable) represents the current timestamp, which you would use to mark the end date of the old records. It typically uses the current date and time to indicate when the record is no longer current.
	4.	df_scd2["customer_id"].isin(df_changes["customer_id"]):
	•	The isin() function checks if the customer_id in df_scd2 is present in df_changes.
	•	This creates a boolean mask (a series of True or False values) that identifies which records in df_scd2 need to be updated based on changes detected in df_changes.
	5.	Updating end_date:
```python
df_scd2.loc[df_scd2["customer_id"].isin(df_changes["customer_id"]), "end_date"] = current_timestamp()
```
	•	Here, we use .loc[] to select all rows in df_scd2 where the customer_id matches any customer_id in df_changes.
	•	For those selected rows, the end_date column is set to current_timestamp().
	•	This marks the date when these records are considered “expired” or no longer the current version.

	6.	Updating current_flag:
```python
df_scd2.loc[df_scd2["customer_id"].isin(df_changes["customer_id"]), "current_flag"] = False
```
	•	Similarly, this line updates the current_flag column for the same set of selected rows.
	•	It sets current_flag to False, indicating that these records are no longer the current version of the customer data.

### Summary

	•	Purpose: This code snippet updates existing records in the target DataFrame (df_scd2) by marking them as no longer current when there are changes in customer data (indicated by df_changes).
	•	Outcome: The records that are updated will have their end_date set to the current timestamp and their current_flag set to False, effectively expiring those records while preserving the historical data in the SCD table.

### Example Scenario

#### Let’s say you have the following records in df_scd2 before running the code:

|customer_id|	name |	end_date  |	current_flag |
|-----------|--------|------------|-------------------|
|1	    |	Alice|	2024-01-01|	True	      |	
|2	    |	Bob  |	2024-01-01|	True	      |
|3	    |	Carol|	2024-01-01|	True	      |

And your df_changes looks like this:

|customer_id	| name |
|---------------|------|
|2		| Bob  |

After executing the code, the df_scd2 will be updated as follows:

|customer_id|	name |	end_date  |	current_flag |
|-----------|--------|------------|-------------------|
|1	    |	Alice|	2024-01-01|	True	      |	
|2	    |	Bob  |	2024-10-20|	False	      |
|3	    |	Carol|	2024-01-01|	True	      |


Here, Bob’s record is marked as expired with the end_date set to the current date (2024-10-20), and current_flag is set to False.
