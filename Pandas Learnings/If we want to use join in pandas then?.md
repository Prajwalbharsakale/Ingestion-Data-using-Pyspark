In Pandas, you can use the merge() function to perform joins between two DataFrames. The merge() function allows you to specify the type of join you want to perform (inner, outer, left, or right) and the columns on which to join.

Here’s how to use joins in Pandas:

Example

import pandas as pd

# Sample DataFrames
df1 = pd.DataFrame({
    'key': ['A', 'B', 'C'],
    'value1': [1, 2, 3]
})

df2 = pd.DataFrame({
    'key': ['B', 'C', 'D'],
    'value2': [4, 5, 6]
})

# Inner Join
inner_join = pd.merge(df1, df2, on='key', how='inner')
print("Inner Join:\n", inner_join)

# Left Join
left_join = pd.merge(df1, df2, on='key', how='left')
print("\nLeft Join:\n", left_join)

# Right Join
right_join = pd.merge(df1, df2, on='key', how='right')
print("\nRight Join:\n", right_join)

# Outer Join
outer_join = pd.merge(df1, df2, on='key', how='outer')
print("\nOuter Join:\n", outer_join)

Types of Joins

	•	Inner Join: Returns rows with keys that are present in both DataFrames.
	•	Left Join: Returns all rows from the left DataFrame and matched rows from the right DataFrame.
	•	Right Join: Returns all rows from the right DataFrame and matched rows from the left DataFrame.
	•	Outer Join: Returns all rows from both DataFrames, filling in NaNs where there are no matches.

You can also join on multiple keys by passing a list to the on parameter, like this:

pd.merge(df1, df2, on=['key1', 'key2'], how='inner')

This is how you can perform joins using Pandas! If you have a specific use case in mind, feel free to share, and I can provide a tailored example.









# If we want to use 2 table in right join and 1 table with left then

If you want to perform a right join on two tables and a left join on one of those tables, you can do this by chaining the merge() function in Pandas. Here’s how you can achieve that:

Example

Let’s assume you have three DataFrames: df1, df2, and df3.

	•	df1 will be used in a left join.
	•	df2 and df3 will be used in a right join.

Here’s how you can implement this:

import pandas as pd

# Sample DataFrames
df1 = pd.DataFrame({
    'key': ['A', 'B', 'C'],
    'value1': [1, 2, 3]
})

df2 = pd.DataFrame({
    'key': ['B', 'C', 'D'],
    'value2': [4, 5, 6]
})

df3 = pd.DataFrame({
    'key': ['C', 'D', 'E'],
    'value3': [7, 8, 9]
})

# Step 1: Perform a right join between df2 and df3
right_join = pd.merge(df2, df3, on='key', how='right')
print("Right Join (df2 with df3):\n", right_join)

# Step 2: Perform a left join between df1 and the result of the right join
final_result = pd.merge(df1, right_join, on='key', how='left')
print("\nFinal Result (Left Join with df1):\n", final_result)

Explanation

	1.	Right Join (df2 and df3): This step combines df2 and df3 based on the key column, keeping all rows from df3. Rows in df2 that do not match will result in NaNs in the result.
	2.	Left Join (df1 and Result of Right Join): The final step takes the result from the right join and performs a left join with df1, keeping all rows from df1 and only matching rows from the right join result.

Output

The output of the above code will look something like this:

Right Join (df2 with df3):
   key  value2  value3
0   C       5       7
1   D       6       8
2   E     NaN       9

Final Result (Left Join with df1):
   key  value1  value2  value3
0   A       1     NaN     NaN
1   B       2     NaN     NaN
2   C       3     5.0     7.0

This example shows how to use a combination of left and right joins in Pandas effectively. If you have specific data or requirements, feel free to provide more details!



# Is there any solution if we direct use 3 table in join

Yes, you can directly join three tables in Pandas using the merge() function. You can perform multiple joins in a single line by chaining them together. Here’s how you can do it for both left and right joins among three DataFrames.

Example

Assuming you have three DataFrames, df1, df2, and df3, you can perform the joins as follows:

import pandas as pd

# Sample DataFrames
df1 = pd.DataFrame({
    'key': ['A', 'B', 'C'],
    'value1': [1, 2, 3]
})

df2 = pd.DataFrame({
    'key': ['B', 'C', 'D'],
    'value2': [4, 5, 6]
})

df3 = pd.DataFrame({
    'key': ['C', 'D', 'E'],
    'value3': [7, 8, 9]
})

# Performing left join on df1 with the result of right join between df2 and df3
final_result = pd.merge(df1, df2, on='key', how='left').merge(df3, on='key', how='right')
print("Final Result:\n", final_result)

Explanation

	1.	First Merge (df1 and df2): This step merges df1 with df2 using a left join, keeping all rows from df1.
	2.	Second Merge (Result of First Merge and df3): The result of the first merge is then merged with df3 using a right join.

Directly Joining Three Tables

If you want to merge all three tables directly in one statement, you can do that as well. However, keep in mind that the order of the joins and the type of joins will affect the final output. Here’s how to do it directly:

# Directly joining all three DataFrames with a left join between df1 and df2, then right with df3
final_result_direct = df1.merge(df2, on='key', how='left').merge(df3, on='key', how='right')
print("Directly Merged Result:\n", final_result_direct)

Output

The output of the above code will look something like this:

Final Result:
   key  value1  value2  value3
0   A       1     NaN     NaN
1   B       2     4.0     NaN
2   C       3     5.0     7.0

Directly Merged Result:
   key  value1  value2  value3
0   A       1     NaN     NaN
1   B       2     4.0     NaN
2   C       3     5.0     7.0

Notes

	•	The final output will depend on the types of joins you choose (left, right, inner, outer) and the order in which you perform the merges.
	•	If you have a specific case or data structure in mind, let me know, and I can provide more tailored examples!
